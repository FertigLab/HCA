Application to "Collaborative Computational Tools for the Human Cell Atlas" https://chanzuckerberg.com/initiatives/rfa

I am applying as part of a team to apply matrix factorization techniques to define biologically-relevant features from large sample size single cell and bulk RNA-seq datasets. Drop a line via issues if you're interested in networking our proposals and/or review.

Cheers,
